To compile and install the `pjproject` library, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `pjproject` directory:
    ```
    cd /path/to/pjproject
    ```

2. Configure the project with the following options:
    ```
    ./configure --enable-shared --with-swig
    ```

3. Build the project, clean intermediate files, and compile:
    ```
    make dep && make clean && make
    ```

4. Go to the SWIG Python folder (often named `python` or something similar).

5. Run the Python setup script to install the library:
    ```
    python setup.py install
    ```

Replace /path/to/pjproject with the actual path to the pjproject directory.
